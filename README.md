# Responsive Webiste Using HTML, SCSS and JS
This responsive website is a part of a video lecture series by 'Joy Shaheb', an educational YouTuber. It serves as a repository containing my learning journey, showcasing a delightful and fully responsive website crafted with HTML, SCSS, and JS.

### Getting Started:<br>
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

**1.** On this Github Repository "**Responsive-Web-Design**" click on "**Code**" and then download the "**Zip file**".<br><br>

<br><br>

**2.** Extract that 'Zip file' in you local system and then open that folder in VS Code.
<br><br>

**3.** As Project Uses **scss** for styling of the web page, so to convert that **scss** to **css** so that browser will understand it
    you have to install a extension "**Live Sass Compiler"**.

<br><br>

**4.** Now, on your VS Code window at the bottom right corner you will get the option as **'Watch Sass'** on clicking that the given
    **scss** files in the project will get converted to **css** and now in every styles folder you will get 2 extra files one of which is 
    **.css** file which I have already included in the project.
