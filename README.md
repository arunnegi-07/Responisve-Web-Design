## Responsive Webiste Using HTML SCSS and JS
This responsive website is a part of a video lecture series by 'Joy Saheb', an educational YouTuber. It serves as a repository containing my learning journey, showcasing a delightful and fully responsive website crafted with HTML, SCSS, and JS.

**Getting Started:**
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

1. On this Github Repository "**Responisve-Web-Design**" click on "**Code**" and then download the "**Zip file**".

2. Extract that 'Zip file' in you local system and then open that folder in VS Code.

3. As Project Uses **scss** for styling of the web page, so to convert that **scss** to **css** so that browser will understand it
    you have to install a extension "Live Sass Compiler**.

4. Now, on your VS Code window at the bottom right corner you will get the option as **Watch Sass** on clicking that the given
    **scss** files in the project will get converted to **css** and now in every styles folder you will get 2 extra files one of which will 
    be a **.css** file.

5. Now, you can run the website in your local machine by just opening **index.html** in any of the browser of your choice.
